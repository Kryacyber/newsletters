    "intro": "This month’s cybersecurity landscape is marked by critical deadlines, evolving AI threats, and persistent malware campaigns. The expiration of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) raises urgent questions about threat intelligence governance, while security leaders are turning to AI for triage and detection—despite overwhelming alert volumes. Meanwhile, zero-click vulnerabilities in AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the ShadowLeak attack highlight new risks in generative AI. Law enforcement actions against hackers and malware distribution campaigns targeting retail and telecom sectors underscore the global scope of cyber threats. Additionally, the CISA has added a critical Linux vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, emphasizing the need for proactive patching. As generative AI’s adoption grows, so too does the attack surface it presents, demanding vigilance across industries."
