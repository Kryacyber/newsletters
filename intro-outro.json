[{"intro":"This week’s cybersecurity highlights reveal a mix of emerging threats and critical vulnerabilities. Researchers uncovered CometJacking, a prompt injection attack targeting AI-driven browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, while GreyNoise detected a 500% surge in scanning activity against Palo Alto Networks login portals. Meanwhile, Red Hat patched a severe OpenShift AI flaw that could allow privilege escalation, and WestJet disclosed a data breach affecting 1.2 million individuals. Other notable developments include the exposure of the Strela Stealer’s operator, Detour Dog, a WhatsApp-based malware campaign in Brazil, and critical vulnerabilities in DrayTek routers and Meteobridge devices. These insights underscore the evolving landscape of cyber threats, from AI-driven attacks to traditional infrastructure weaknesses."},{"outro":"This week’s cybersecurity landscape highlights the growing sophistication of threats, from AI-driven attacks like CometJacking to traditional vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. The surge in scanning activity against Palo Alto Networks and the exposure of the Strela Stealer’s operator, Detour Dog, reveal how attackers are adapting to new technologies. Meanwhile, the Red Hat OpenShift AI flaw and WestJet’s data breach underscore the persistent risks of privilege escalation and human error. These incidents emphasize the need for proactive defenses, whether addressing AI security, patching critical systems, or mitigating malware campaigns. As cyber threats evolve, staying vigilant and adapting to emerging risks is essential."}]
